# Logo-Maker


## Description

By answering prompts you can create your own logo.
My motivation was to create a easy way for business or people to create quick simple logos.
I built this to make logos an easy step in owning a business or creating a webpage.
The problem it solves is it takes the time and difficulty out of creating a logo.
I learned how to take user input and create an image.
